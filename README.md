# Lucky Cat - NEKO
NEKO is a good luck charm token on Avalanche C-Chain. Buy it to make your wallet lucky.

## Vision
NEKO wants to help Avalanche platform hit the mainstream. To do that NEKO positions itself as a good luck charm - something people new to Avalanche should get with their very first AVAX coins. 

We want buying NEKO with your first AVAX to become a ritual - something people do every time they set up a new wallet.

The token itself is very simple ERC20 token designed not to confuse people new to cryptoverse. The team does regular NFT drops and other activities to create NEKO-culture and embed the character in cryptoverse and beyond.
